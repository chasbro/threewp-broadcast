Inspired by <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/broadcast-mu/">Tom Lynch's Broadcast MU plugin</a> that doesn't work nowadays due to autosaving and such.

Has options for whitelisting (required blogs), blacklisting, user role access granularity, category and/or tag posting (if the blogs have the same category slugs) and category/tag creation (automatically, per user role) and an uninstall to completely remove itself.

Available in the following languages:
