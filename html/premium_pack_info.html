<h3>Queue</h3>

Need to broadcast to <strong>tens</strong> or <strong>hundreds</strong> of child <strong>blogs</strong>? It's not possible without queue because of PHP timeouts and memory restraints. When enabled, <em>Queue</em> will automatically put all broadcasts, new posts and updates, into a queue that is processed via Javascript in the browser.

<h3>Views</h3>

Adds support for <a href="http://wp-types.com/">WP Types and Views</a> content templates. The child blog needs a content template with the exact same name as the one on the parent for the template to be correctly transferred.
