<h3>Queue</h3>

Need to broadcast to <strong>tens</strong> or <strong>hundreds</strong> of child <strong>blogs</strong>? It's not possible without queue because of PHP timeouts and memory restraints. When enabled, <em>Queue</em> will automatically put all broadcasts, new posts and updates, into a queue that is processed via Javascript in the browser.
